        NASA Selects Five U.S. Companies to Mature Artemis Lander Concepts
      </h2>

      <p>
        NASA has selected five U.S. companies to help the agency enable a steady
        pace of crewed trips to the lunar surface under the agency’s Artemis
        program. These companies will make advancements toward sustainable human
        landing system concepts, conduct risk-reduction activities, and provide
        feedback on NASA’s requirements to cultivate industry capabilities for
        crewed lunar landing missions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The awards under the Next Space Technologies for Exploration
        Partnerships (NextSTEP-2) Appendix N broad agency announcement are firm
        fixed-price, milestone-based contracts. The total combined value for the
        awards is $146 million, and the work will be conducted over the next 15
        months. The companies that received awards and their award values are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Origin Federation of Kent, Washington, $25.6 million.</li>
        <li>
          Dynetics (a Leidos company) of Huntsville, Alabama, $40.8 million.
        </li>
        <li>Lockheed Martin of Littleton, Colorado, $35.2 million.</li>
        <li>Northrop Grumman of Dulles, Virginia, $34.8 million.</li>
        <li>SpaceX of Hawthorne, California, $9.4 million.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        “Establishing a long-term human presence on the Moon through recurring
        services using lunar landers is a major Artemis goal,” said Kathy
        Lueders, NASA’s associate administrator for Human Exploration and
        Operations at Headquarters in Washington. “This critical step lays the
        foundation for U.S. leadership in learning more about the Moon and for
        learning how to live and work in deep space for future missions farther
        into the solar system.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The selected companies will develop lander design concepts, evaluating
        their performance, design, construction standards, mission assurance
        requirements, interfaces, safety, crew health accommodations, and
        medical capabilities. The companies will also mitigate lunar lander
        risks by conducting critical component tests and advancing the maturity
        of key technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        The work from these companies will ultimately help shape the strategy
        and requirements for a future NASA’s solicitation to provide regular
        astronaut transportation from lunar orbit to the surface of the Moon.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Collaboration with our partners is critical to achieving NASA’s
        long-term Artemis lunar exploration goals,” said Lisa Watson-Morgan,
        Human Landing System Program manager at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight
        Center in Huntsville, Alabama. “By partnering with innovative U.S.
        companies, we will establish a robust lunar economy while exploring new
        areas of the Moon for generations to come.”
      </p>
      <p>
        This opportunity is distinct from the initial crewed lunar landing
        demonstration mission awarded under the NextSTEP-2 Appendix H
        procurement, which will serve as the proof of concept for the Artemis
        architecture.
      </p>
      <p>
        NASA’s goals under Artemis include enabling a safe and cost-efficient
        long-term approach to accessing the lunar surface and becoming one of
        multiple customers purchasing services in a lunar transportation market.
        Much of what the agency develops for the Moon will be applied to future
        exploration at Mars.
      </p>
      <p>
        NASA’s Artemis missions include landing the first woman and first person
        of color on the lunar surface, sending a suite of new science
        instruments and technology demonstrations to study the Moon, and
        establishing a long-term presence there.
