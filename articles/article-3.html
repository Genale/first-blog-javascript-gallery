      <h2>NASA Finds 2021 Arctic Summer Sea Ice 12th-Lowest on Record</h2>
      <p class="date">Sep 22, 2021</p>
      <p>
        Sea ice in the Arctic appears to have hit its annual minimum extent on
        Sept. 16, after waning in the 2021 Northern Hemisphere spring and
        summer. The summertime extent is the 12th-lowest in the satellite
        record, according to scientists at the NASA-supported National Snow and
        Ice Data Center and NASA.
      </p>
      <p>
        This year, the minimum extent of Arctic sea ice dropped to 4.72 million
        square kilometers (1.82 million square miles). Sea ice extent is defined
        as the total area in which ice concentration is at least 15%.
      </p>
      <p>
        The average September minimum extent record shows significant declines
        since satellites began measuring consistently in 1978. The last 15 years
        (2007 to 2021) are the lowest 15 minimum extents in the 43-year
        satellite record.
