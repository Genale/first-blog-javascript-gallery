      <h3>Hubble Captures a Cluster in the Heart of the Milky Way</h3>

        This sparkling starfield, captured by the NASA/ESA Hubble Space
        Telescope’s Wide Field Camera 3 and Advanced Camera for Surveys,
        contains the globular cluster ESO 520-21 (also known as Palomar 6). A
        densely packed, roughly spherical collection of stars, it lies close to
        the center of the Milky Way, where interstellar gas and dust absorb
        starlight and make observations more challenging.
