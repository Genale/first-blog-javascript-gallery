        <p>Hi and welcome to my blog!</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Here I like to share intresting posts related with different themes
          such as cooking, nutrition, tv, acting, sports and much more. This
          month I am going to share with you intresting articles about the
          space. This is the first edition of this blog so feel welcome to leave
          feedback and suggestions of new themes to publish.
        </p>

          This blog is a little different than the rest. In my blog I like to
          share new and different content every month. I also have a gallery
          where I like to share pictures of trips I consider outstanding and
          memorable, so feel welcome to check that up!

        <h2>A little bit of information about myself...</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Alessandra and I am 21 years old. I come originally from
          Mexico. I have two pets back in my home country. I really like
          barbacoa, which is a Mexican dish, and I am happily married to the
          love of my life.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I really like languages and I aim to get to be fluent in at least five
          different in a near future. I can speak fluently Spansih, English and
          Swedish at the moment though.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I have been mostly studying Swedish before and as well working as a
          Spanish teacher online.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I recently became curious about web-development and realized I would
          actually enjoy to learn more about it. Therefore I decided to study at
          home and start to learn. Later on I decided to try Yrkeshögskola to
          get a good foundation, learn even more and to make it my profession.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I would like to work with web-development after I finish this program.
