    <h3>Hubble Captures a Cluster in the Heart of the Milky Way</h3>

    <p>
      This sparkling starfield, captured by the NASA/ESA Hubble Space
      Telescope’s Wide Field Camera 3 and Advanced Camera for Surveys,
      contains the globular cluster ESO 520-21 (also known as Palomar 6). A
      densely packed, roughly spherical collection of stars, it lies close to
      the center of the Milky Way, where interstellar gas and dust absorb
      starlight and make observations more challenging.
